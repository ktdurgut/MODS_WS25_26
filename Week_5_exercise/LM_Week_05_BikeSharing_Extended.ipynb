    "For now our data shows us on which date bikes were rented but does not specify the weekday.  \n",
    "But what if there is a pattern that shows us that more bikes were rented on Sundays?  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case we can extract the information __weekday__ from our object __datetime__ by using the function `.dt.day_name()`.     \n",
    "Same thing goes for the extraction of the specific time at which a bike was rented by using the attribute `.dt.hour`.    \n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, we have to dummy encode the categorical variables, since variables such as weekdays, workdays, hours, etc. are represented by numbers and therefore interpreted as numerical variables by default.\n",
    "For each column that should be dummy encoded, the `OneHotEncoder` looks how many different values are present in that column and creates a new column for each of them. The values of the newly created column are either 1 or 0 depending on the former value of the row.\n",
    "For Example if you dummy encode __season__, you get the three columns __season_2__, __season_3__ and __season_4__. To understand the values let's look at __season_2__. In this column there is the value `1` in a row if the value of the column __season__ was `2`. \n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this in python we use the class `OneHotEncoder` of scikit-learn (sklearn). \n",
    "First you have to create an object of it which can take the arguments:\n",
    "- __drop:__ Drops the first factor level. In our case the first season. This is done because all the information of the season column can be represented without one factor level. Imagine you want to know if a row with the already dummy encoded season is in the first season. You can check for all dummy columns if they contain a False. If None of them contain a True the season must have been season 1 which is the dropped factor level.\n",
    "- __handle_unknown:__ Specifies how to deal with new data that contains a factor which was not present when the OneHotEncoder was fit. For example we can come back to the season column and imagine our training set only consists of the first two seasons of the year. Now we want to fit our OneHotEncoder to the data it will not know the other two seasons. If you want to transform your test data we have to specify how to deal with these unknown categories.\n",
    "In our case we chose `infrequent_if_exist` which assigns an infrequent category where the category was unknown before.\n",
    "- __sparse_output:__ We set it to `False` as by default we receive a sparse matrix as output and that cannot be easily processed into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we created the object we can fit it to our data and simultaneously transform our training dataset by calling `fit_transform` on our OneHotEncoder. As input we pass it a subset of our training data consisting of all the columns we want to transform.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our test set we proceed analogously, but we use the `transform` method instead of `fit_transform` because now we only want the method to transform the learned categories and deal with the unknown as specified in the argument `handle_unknown` of the `OneHotEncoder`. By fitting the OneHotEncoder on the training set and only transforming the test set we ensure that no information is leaked from our test set into our training set."
